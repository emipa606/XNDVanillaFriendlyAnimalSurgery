[strike]# **Compatibility**

For Modders: To make a patch for this mod, simply plug the defNames of your mod&apos;s animals into the appropriate XML patches. Vanilla animal patches can be found in Patches/Core for reference.[/strike]

I wouldn&apos;t recommend using this *and* &apos;A Dog Said&apos; together due to the overlap of parts and balance inconsistencies that will be introduced.

Recommended to use with https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2270547158]**Animal Armor** to maximize the customization of your animals.

[strike]No animal mods have been made compatible with this yet. I&apos;m not going to be responsible for creating compatibility patches with other mods either.[/strike]

# **Overview**

For those that still want animal surgery in the game but don&apos;t like the &apos;one size fits all&apos; philosophy of A Dog Said (e.g. the same bionic part fitting on a squirrel that also fits on an elephant).

Vanilla-Friendly Animal Surgery adds the following body parts for animals: dentures; peg legs; hearts; kidneys; lungs; livers; simple prosthetic arms; simple prosthetic legs; bionic arms; bionic eyes; bionic legs and painstoppers. Dentures and peg legs are installed on animals in the same way that you&apos;d install them on a colonist in vanilla RimWorld.

Similarly, larger parts are going to be more powerful than their smaller brethren: a small bionic leg might do 8 damage if installed frontally, but a large one will do 15.

These are the five size categories:
**Tiny -** Fits on animals with a mature body size of less than 0.3, such as chickens and squirrels.
**Small -** Fits on animals with a mature body size between 0.3 and 0.7, such as monkeys and alphabeavers.
**Medium -** Fits on animals with a mature body size between 0.7 and 1.3, such as boars and ostriches.
**Large -** Fits on animals with a mature body size between 1.3 and 2.4, such as muffalo and bears.
**Huge -** Fits on animals with a mature body size equal to or greater than 2.4, such as rhinoceroses and thrumbos.

[strike]Animal organs and prostheses, similar to human prostheses in the base game, can only be obtained via trade; you can&apos;t produce them or expect them to come falling from the sky. For balance reasons and due to XML limitations, you can&apos;t harvest animals for their organs either; they also can only be obtained via trade.[/strike]

Animal body parts also have their own trade categories, so these won&apos;t interfere with the commonality of human body parts on the market. Additionally, adding part to and removing parts from animals only yields 5/16ths as much experience as an operation on a human, to reduce the feasibility of experience grinding.
